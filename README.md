# Android: RVbnb

Do you have land that you're currently not using and would like to make some extra money? Create a Landowner user account through RVbnb and post a listing of your land on the app so that RV owners can make a reservation and use your land. 

Or if you're a RV owner, have you ever found RV parks over crowded or unavailable during your trip? Create a RV Owner user account through RVbnb and gain access to privately owned land that would have been previously unavailable to you.

RVbnb is a great app that connects landowners and RV owners together. 

## Login/Register Pages:
The user must login as either a Landowner or a RV Owner (must sign in as the account they registered for). If the user does not have an account, they can click on the "Register" button. On the registration page, the user must select whether they are registering as a Landowner or a RV Owner.
